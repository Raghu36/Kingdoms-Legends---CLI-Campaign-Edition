Kingdom’s Last Stand 🏰⚔️

Welcome, Hero!

You’ve been chosen to defend the kingdom against waves of beasts and the ultimate foe — The Mimic Beast 🐉. This is a terminal-based survival strategy game where your wit, timing, and smart choices decide the fate of the realm.

🎮 How to Play The game board is a 9x9 grid. You are the Hero (H) starting at the top-left. Enemies (E) spawn at the bottom-right and chase you. Reach the enemy’s base (bottom-right) to clear a level.

Controls: W → Move Up S → Move Down A → Move Left D → Move Right L → Use a Lifeline (push enemy back) P → Use Power-Up (Final Boss only, once per run) Q → Save & Quit

⚡ Features 15 campaign levels with scaling difficulty. Gold system → Earn 10 gold per win, spend 50 gold for lifelines. Lifelines → Start with 3, +1 every 4 levels. Mimic Beast Boss Fight (Level 16): Predicts your moves. Mimics your playstyle. Only 3 attempts allowed — fail, and you restart from Level 1. Persistent Progress → Quit anytime, resume later. Adaptive AI → Gets smarter the more you play.

Built with Python, coffee ☕, and a little chaos. Designed to challenge players who love strategy, survival, and a pinch of unfair AI.
